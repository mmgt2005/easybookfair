# Changelog

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project doesn't use semantic versioning yet — entries are grouped
under `[Unreleased]` until Phase 1 produces a first working release, at
which point versioning starts.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Catalog item images can now be uploaded as a file from `/admin/catalog/new`
  instead of only pasted as a URL — stored in a new public Supabase Storage
  bucket (`catalog-images`, migration `0008`), write-restricted to platform
  admins. CSV bulk upload still takes `image_url` as a URL string (bulk
  imports are expected to already have hosted images).
- Phase 2 (admin catalog + allocation):
  - Supabase Auth wiring: session-refresh middleware, magic-link
    `/login`, `/auth/callback`, and a `requireAdmin()` guard for admin
    routes (backed by RLS, not just a UX check).
  - `catalog_items.stock_on_hand` (migration `0006`) — Phase 1 tracked
    allocations but never tracked actual warehouse stock to check them
    against.
  - `public.allocate_inventory()` RPC — locks the catalog row, checks
    and decrements stock, upserts the allocation, and posts the
    allocation ledger entry as one atomic operation; rejects
    over-allocation outright. `app.*` stays internal-only (not exposed
    over the API); `public.*` is now the deliberate RPC surface for
    business actions like this one, callable from Server Actions using
    the signed-in admin's own session.
  - Admin screens: `/admin/catalog` (list, quick-add, CSV bulk upload),
    `/admin/organizations` and `/admin/fairs` (minimal scaffolding, not
    the real application-review/Stripe-onboarding or fair-creation
    screens — just enough for a fair to exist), and
    `/admin/fairs/[id]/allocations` (the allocation checklist:
    availability check, lead-time-aware "reorder now" vs. manual-decision
    flag, and a packing suggestion).
  - Packing suggestion is a **weight-only heuristic** (cartons needed ≈
    total allocated weight ÷ carton capacity) — not true volumetric
    packing. Seeded 3 generic carton sizes (migration `0007`) since
    there's no carton-spec management screen yet.
  - Validated against a real local Postgres instance again: the RPC's
    authorization check, atomic stock decrement + ledger posting,
    upsert-on-repeat-allocation, and rejection-with-no-partial-write on
    insufficient stock all covered by a smoke test.
- Phase 1 foundation:
  - Next.js + Supabase project skeleton (`app/`, `lib/supabase/`), builds
    and typechecks cleanly.
  - Full schema migration (`supabase/migrations/0001`–`0005`) implementing
    every table in the spec's data model, plus `platform_admins` — a
    minimal stand-in for a platform-admin role, needed for RLS before
    Phase 7's three-tier roles exist.
  - Double-entry ledger: `app.post_journal_entry()` posts a balanced
    entry or rejects it, backed by a deferred constraint trigger on
    `journal_lines` that enforces the same invariant independently of the
    function. `settlements` has check constraints pinning the net-payout
    formula directly in the schema.
  - Seeded chart of accounts (the 7 accounts from `docs/spec.md`).
  - Foundational RLS: org-scoped access via `app.current_org_ids()`,
    platform-admin bypass via `app.is_platform_admin()`, default-deny on
    tables that should only ever be written by trusted server code
    (`sales`, `journal_entries`, `webhook_events`, `settlements`).
  - All of the above validated against a real local Postgres instance
    (schema applies cleanly; ledger balance enforcement, settlement
    check constraints, and RLS scoping all verified with a smoke test),
    not just reviewed as SQL.

- Initial design spec (`docs/spec.md`): data model, chart of accounts,
  screens, and core workflows for a per-fair book consignment platform.
- User manual (`docs/MANUAL.md`) and this changelog.
- Petty-cash suggestion workflow: suggests a starting cash-drawer float
  and denomination breakdown per fair, from allocation price points and
  an org's cash-vs-card sales ratio.

### Changed

- Settlement journal entries split into explicit card/online vs. cash
  patterns (the original single "any channel" pattern risked
  double-counting an org's margin on cash sales).
- Fair lifecycle collapsed to a single `scheduled → active →
  return_window → closed` sequence, so settlement is computed once,
  after returns are known, instead of being locked at fair-end and later
  amended for missing inventory.
- Net payout formula written out explicitly, including missing-inventory
  cost, which the original prose described but didn't formalize.
- Stripe Connect charge model pinned down: platform is merchant of
  record, using separate charges and transfers, rather than left
  ambiguous between that and a destination-charge model.
- `catalog_items` generalized to support non-book merchandise (pencils,
  erasers, posters, journals, etc.): ISBN made optional, `item_type`
  added; QR/label generation and lead-time/restock logic already didn't
  depend on ISBN specifically.

### Deferred (explicitly, not by omission)

- Sales tax calculation and remittance.
- Chargeback/dispute reconciliation beyond a basic refund.
